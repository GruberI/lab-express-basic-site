            <p class="pg2-p">Sir Thomas Sean Connery (25 August 1930 â€“ 31 October 2020) was a Scottish actor. He gained recognition as the first actor to portray fictional British secret agent James Bond in film, starring in seven Bond films between 1962 and 1983. Originating the role in Dr. No, Connery played Bond in six Eon Productions' entries and made his final appearance in the Jack Schwartzman-produced Never Say Never</p>
            <p class="pg2-p">Connery began acting in smaller theatre and television productions until his breakout role as Bond. Although he did not enjoy the off-screen attention the role gave him, the success brought film offers from famed directors such as Alfred Hitchcock, Sidney Lumet and John Huston for dramatic roles. Connery officially retired from acting in 2006, although he briefly returned for voice over roles in 2012.</p>
            <p class="pg2-p">His achievements in film were recognised with an Academy Award, two BAFTA Awards (including the BAFTA Fellowship), and three Golden Globes, including the Cecil B. DeMille Award and a Henrietta Award. In 1987 he was made a Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters in France, and he received the US Kennedy Center Honors lifetime achievement award in 1999. Connery was knighted in the 2000 New Year Honours for services to film drama</p>
